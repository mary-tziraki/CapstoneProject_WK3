# The CapstoneProject_WK3
Contains projects and assignments on exploring neighbourhoods at the city of Toronto.
I have separated in the 3 following parts.

Part 1 : The task is to scrap and wrangle the wikipedia page with the postal codes of Canada, set them and data frames and clean the data.
         I have used pandas library for webscrapping 

Part 2 : The task is to find the latitude and longitude of each neighbourhood either from geocoder or from csv files of geospatial data 

Part 3 : Is the complete Notebook of the assignment where all the codes of part 1 and 2 together with the additional task. For practise here I am using the Beautiful Soup for web scrapping 
         The 3rd task is to explore and cluster the Neighbourhoods in Toronto. I also use map visualisation and see in colour the clustered neighbourhoods
